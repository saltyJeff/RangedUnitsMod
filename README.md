# Ranged Units Mod
Ranged Units Mod for Civ 5

There's a lot of suggestions in the thread and I don't have time to implement them; and a bunch of them are conflicting too.
Probably too late but here's the source code if you haven't realized its not compiled in the Mods directory.

You'll need to go to the Steam program; Hilight "Library" and select "Tools" and install the Civ 5 SDK
Copy units.xml into the XML folder of the default project structure.
